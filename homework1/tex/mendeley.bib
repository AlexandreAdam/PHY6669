abstract = {There appears to be widespread confusion as to why the intensity of the extragalactic background light (EBL) is low. This concerns in particular the relative importance of factors associated with the lifetime of the galaxies and the expansion of the universe. To remedy this, an improved derivation is given of the main relations for the EBL. Then a new method is used to show explicitly what effect the expansion has on the EBL in Friedmann-Robertson-Walker models. It is thereby confirmed that the intensity of intergalactic light is determined to order of magnitude by the lifetime of the galaxies and only affected by a factor of about 2 by the expansion of the universe.},

@techreport{Wesson1991,
abstract = {In this paper, the intensity of the extragalactic background light (EBL) due to stars in galaxies is calculated, first in expanding uniform cosmological models and then in equivalent static models, making it possible to separate the influence of the expansion of the universe from that of the age of galaxies. It is shown that the EBL intensity is proportional to the age of the galaxies in a static model. However, the intensity also depends on the speed of light, the luminosity density of galaxies, and the form of a typical galaxy spectrum. The redshift effect present in the expression for an expanding model only causes a reductiomn of 3-4, confirming the conclusion of Harrison (1977, 1981) concerning the Olbers's paradox. Theoretical values for the intensity were found to agree with presently available limits on the EBL from observations.},
