abstract = {The cosmic radio-frequency spectrum is expected to show a strong absorption signal corresponding to the 21-centimetre-wavelength transition of atomic hydrogen around redshift 20, which arises from Lyman-$\alpha$ radiation from some of the earliest stars. By observing this 21-centimetre signal - either its sky-averaged spectrum or maps of its fluctuations, obtained using radio interferometers - we can obtain information about cosmic dawn, the era when the first astrophysical sources of light were formed. The recent detection of the global 21-centimetre spectrum reveals a stronger absorption than the maximum predicted by existing models, at a confidence level of 3.8 standard deviations. Here we report that this absorption can be explained by the combination of radiation from the first stars and excess cooling of the cosmic gas induced by its interaction with dark matter. Our analysis indicates that the spatial fluctuations of the 21-centimetre signal at cosmic dawn could be an order of magnitude larger than previously expected and that the dark-matter particle is no heavier than several proton masses, well below the commonly predicted mass of weakly interacting massive particles. Our analysis also confirms that dark matter is highly non-relativistic and at least moderately cold, and primordial velocities predicted by models of warm dark matter are potentially detectable. These results indicate that 21-centimetre cosmology can be used as a dark-matter probe.},

abstract = {Recently the EDGES collaboration reported an anomalous absorption signal in the sky-averaged 21-cm spectrum around z = 17. Such a signal may be understood as an indication for an unexpected cooling of the hydrogen gas during or prior to the so called Cosmic Dawn era. Here we explore the possibility that sub GeV dark matter cooled the gas through velocity-dependent, Rutherford-like interactions. We argue that such interactions require a light mediator that is highly constrained by 5th force experiments and limits from stellar cooling. Consequently, only a hidden or the visible photon can in principle mediate such a force. Neutral hydrogen thus plays a sub-leading role and the cooling occurs via the residual free electrons and protons. We find that these two scenarios are strongly constrained by the predicted dark matter self-interactions and by limits on millicharged dark matter respectively. We conclude that the 21-cm absorption line is unlikely to be the result of gas cooling via the scattering with a dominant component of the dark matter. An order 1% subcomponent of millicharged dark matter remains a viable explanation.},

@article{Tashiro2014,
abstract = {We demonstrate that elastic scattering between dark matter (DM) and baryons can affect the thermal evolution of the intergalactic medium at early epochs and discuss the observational consequences. We show that, due to the interaction between DM and baryons, the baryon temperature is cooled after decoupling from the CMB temperature. We illustrate our findings by calculating the 21 cm power spectrum in coexistence with a velocity-dependent DM elastic scattering cross section. For instance, for a DM mass of 10 GeV, the 21 cm brightness temperature angular power spectrum can be suppressed by a factor 2 within the currently allowed DM-baryon cross section bounded by the CMB and large-scale structure data. This scale-independent suppression of the angular power spectrum can be even larger for a smaller DM mass with a common cross section (for instance, as large as a factor 10 for $m_d\sim 1$ GeV), and such an effect would be of great interest for probing the nature of DM in view of forthcoming cosmological surveys.},

@article{Madau1996,
abstract = {We investigate the 21-cm signature that may arise from the intergalactic medium (IGM) prior to the epoch of full reionization (z>5). In scenarios in which the IGM is reionized by discrete sources of photoionizing radiation, the neutral gas which has not yet been engulfed by an H II region may easily be preheated to temperatures well above that of the cosmic background radiation (CBR), rendering the IGM invisible in absorption against the CBR. We identify three possible preheating mechanisms: (1) photoelectric heating by soft X-rays from QSOs, (2) photoelectric heating by soft X-rays from early galactic halos, and (3) resonant scattering of the continuum UV radiation from an early generation of stars. In the presence of a sufficiently strong ambient flux of Lyman-alpha photons, the hyperfine transition in the warmed H I will be excited. A beam differencing experiment would detect a patchwork of emission, both in frequency and in angle across the sky. This patchwork could serve as a valuable tool for understanding the epoch, nature, and sources of the reionization of the universe, and their implications for cosmology. We demonstrate that isolated QSOs will produce detectable signals at meter wavelengths within their ``spheres of influence'' over which they warm the IGM. As a result of the redshifted 21-cm radiation emitted by warm H I bubbles, the spectrum of the radio extragalactic background will display frequency structure with velocity widths up to 10,000 km/s. Broad beam observations would reveal corresponding angular fluctuations in the sky intensity with (delta T/T)=1E-3 on degree-scales. Radio measurements near 235 and 150 MHz, as will be possible in the near future using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, may provide the first detection of a neutral IGM at 5<z<10.},

@article{Conselice2016,
abstract = {The evolution of the number density of galaxies in the universe, and thus also the total number of galaxies, is a fundamental question with implications for a host of astrophysical problems including galaxy evolution and cosmology. However there has never been a detailed study of this important measurement, nor a clear path to answer it. To address this we use observed galaxy stellar mass functions up to $z\sim8$ to determine how the number densities of galaxies changes as a function of time and mass limit. We show that the increase in the total number density of galaxies ($\phi_{\rm T}$), more massive than M$_{*} = 10^{6}$ M_0, decreases as $\phi_{\rm T} \sim t^{-1}$, where $t$ is the age of the universe. We further show that this evolution turns-over and rather increases with time at higher mass lower limits of M$_{*}>10^{7}$ M_0. By using the M$_{*}=10^{6}$ M_0 lower limit we further show that the total number of galaxies in the universe up to $z = 8$ is $2.0^{+0.7}_{-0.6} \times 10^{12}$ (two trillion), almost a factor of ten higher than would be seen in an all sky survey at Hubble Ultra-Deep Field depth. We discuss the implications for these results for galaxy evolution, as well as compare our results with the latest models of galaxy formation. These results also reveal that the cosmic background light in the optical and near-infrared likely arise from these unobserved faint galaxies. We also show how these results solve the question of why the sky at night is dark, otherwise known as Olbers' paradox.},
